What is 1 NF
> no repeated rows of data
> column only contains single value
> table has a primary key

What is 2 Nf
> they conform to 1NF
> every column  that is not a primary key of the table is
dependent on the whole of the primary key


What is 3nF

> they conforn to 2nf
> Every column that is not a primary key  is only
  dependent on the whole of the primary key
